# CSS advanced

## üìÑ <span id="description">Description</span>

In this section, the main objective was to concentrate on the CSS and overall styling of the page. Using the HTML structure from the previous project, the task was to visually replicate the website shown in the screenshot as closely as possible by applying fundamental CSS techniques.


<br>
The site is not responsive, so for a better comparison with the reference image, I recommend testing it on a computer.
<br>
On a mobile device, the experience may not be optimal, but please bear in mind that responsiveness was not the focus of this exercise.

## üéì <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

At the end of this project, I had to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google** :

- What is CSS?
- How to add style to an element.
- What is a class?
- What is a selector?
- How to compute CSS Specificity Value.
- What are Box properties in CSS?
- How does the browser load a webpage.

This project is following the HTML, advanced project - please make sure all tasks of this previous one are fully done.

For this project, you will focus on the CSS and the style of the page.

This designer file will be available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/fr-fr/) - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

- [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?node-id=0-1)
- [fig file](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/webstack/Homepage.fig)

And ‚ÄúDuplicate to your Drafts‚Äù to have access to all design details (if not already done).


Important notes with Figma:

- If your computer doesn‚Äôt have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT).
- Some values are in float - feel free to round them.

For this task, please write an amazing `README.md` and copy the `index.html` file from `HTML, advanced`.
